# mobi

Welcome! This is the repository for the new and fresh
Mobi language.

Mobi is currently made in Python to provide a
better and easier developer experience but
the goal is to build up and fortify the compiler
enough to rewrite Mobi into itself. Mobi 1.0.

Currently this language is experimental and anything can be rewritten at anytime.
So please use with caution, especially since
many safety methods and techniques have yet to be
implemented nor completed.

## The Goal

Currently no fully fleshed out goal is made,
but a singular one was put behind this up there.

But to summarize: Mobi is supposed to be a
language syntactically similar to TypeScript, Rust, and Python
in type safety, memory safety, ease of use, etc.

The compiler will be like no compiler ever seen
before since it'll be implemented completely in Python,
same with our official tooling until Mobi is usable for them.
